# linja pona

*sitelen pona* is a script for *toki pona*.

The hieroglyphs were created by Sonja Lang, the creator of toki pona.
They appear in [Toki Pona: The Language of Good](https://tokipona.org/).

I have created a font called *linja pona*, it means “simple line”.
With linja pona, I wanted to create a standard font that was simple and that could be read easily at different sizes.

## Usage

To use *compound glyphs*, put a *hyphen* or *plus* between two words,
e.g.: *toki-pona*, *linja+pona*

To use *cartouches*, use square brackets and underscores before each glyph,
e.g.: *ma [_kasi_alasa_nasin_awen_telo_aa] li suli*
